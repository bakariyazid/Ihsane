    <h1 class="hy"> SCHOOL RULES AND REGULATIONS </h1>
    <p class="tb"> Koranic schools often have rules that include: </p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 1. VISITORS </h1>
    <p class="tb"> School is a place of business. Visitors are not permitted
        during the school day. On rare occasions, and with a prior 
        24 hour notice, a visitor's pass may be issued by administration.
        No visitors are to be admitted to any class without such a pass. 
        Even with a pass, an individual teacher can refuse to admit a visitor 
        if the visit would be inappropriate. On entering the school, parents 
        and guardians are asked to check in with the Main Office. </p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 2. COMMUNICATION WITH THE SCHOOL  </h1>
            <p class="tb"> The primary method of communication between the school and parents/students
            is by e-mail. The school communicates with parents through the email addresses
            stored in the student's record. When corresponding with the school the sender
            must type the full name of the student and the student's grade in the email body. </p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 3. COMMUNICATING ANNOUNCEMENTS </h1>
            <p class="tb"> All announcements are sent to the school's mailing list, and placed on the Board 
            section on the Homepage of the school's website. Parent emails are added to the school 
            mailing list automatically at the beginning of the school year. There is also a subscribe 
            button on the Homepage allowing parents to add their personal emails to the mailing list. </p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 3. MEETINGS </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Meetings between parents and the school administrators or teachers are scheduled by e-mail. 
            Parents requesting a meeting must provide the name of the student, grade, and a brief description 
            of the purpose of the meeting in the email. </p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 4. FEES AND FINANCES </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Students must pay the fees in full at registration time as per the fee payment instructions 
            provided at registration time. The registration fee (and any other administrative fees) is non-refundable. 
            The tuition fee and Lunch fees are non-refundable after the third week of the academic year. </p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 5. OBJECTIVES </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Ensure the safety and dignity of students and staff;Maintain a positive, weapons-free, 
            drug-free and bullying-free learning environment;Keep school property and the property of 
            others secure;Address the causes of a student's misbehavior and provide opportunities to all 
            individuals involved in an incident to participate in its resolution;Teach students positive 
            behavioural skills to become independent, self-disciplined citizens in the school community and society</p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 6. DRESS CODE </h1>
    <p class="tb"> Students and staff are expected to follow Islamic 
        dress codes, which may include wearing long pants 
        and long-sleeved shirts. Girls may be encouraged 
        to wear long skirts and head scarves. Your dressing 
        should always be cleaned. </p>
 
    <h1 class="yh"> 7. PUNCTUALITY </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Students are expected to be on time and attend at least 80% of classes.</p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 8. RESPECT </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Students are expected to treat everyone with respect, including teachers, classmates, and other adults. </p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 9. ELECTRONIC DEVICES </h1>
            <p> Electronic devices like phones, MP3 players, and game boys are usually not allowed in class. </p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 10. FOODS AND SNACKS </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Food and snacks are often not allowed in classrooms. </p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 11. BEHAVIOR </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Students are expected to follow instructions, be helpful, and keep the school tidy. 
            They should also avoid behaviors like fighting, intimidation, and racial slurs. </p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 12. ACADEMIC WORK </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Students are expected to work hard and look after their teaching environment.

            them might face consequences and risks suspension, or even expulsion. This code of conduct 
            has been developed to emphasize Islamic values and to cultivate a feeling of self-worth and 
            self-discipline in students. It is an expression of the school's climate and its atmosphere 
            for learning. A positive climate is an environment in which all students feel that they are 
            encouraged to participate and are a valued part of the school. </p>

    <h1 class="yh"> 15. CONSEQUENCES </h1>
            <p class="tb">Misconduct will always have consequences. Depending on the seriousness and circumstances 
            of the misconduct, consequences vary and may include suspension and/or expulsion.</p>
            <p class="tb"> Misconduct will be dealt with by the teacher, then by the Section Supervisor or the head
             office as it warrants. The student will receive a warning for minor offences. Major offences
             will be dealt with directly by the Main Office. The student will be expelled upon receiving 
             3 warnings during the school year. </p>

             <p class="tb"> Leaving the school building without permission
